The goal was to create a well organized readMe.md file.  I managed to get it to be well organized, but was unable to get the descriptive text to enter  under the headings.  I couldn't figure out how to manage the flow of the code.  It kept running regardless of how I tried to stop it.  

I have an idea of how to make it work, but don't have time to implement it before the homework is due.  I'm going to create a series of functions to deal with each heading.
